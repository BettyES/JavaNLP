# JavaNLP
Some simple methods for text analysis implemenyted in a JavaFX GUI

### About this repository

This repository was mainly built as a personal exercise to improve JavaFX coding and learn about NLP 

#### Prerequisites

To get the GUI up and running on your local machine, for either fun or development and testing purposes, you need to have Java installed on your system.

Also, I recommend using IntelliJ as an IDE.

Adding apache.commons.io library to external:
1. Download library from https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/download_io.cgi to any folder you fancy
2. In intelliJ click on external libraries -> library Settings -> Global libraries -> + -> browse for the apache.commons...jar file and add

#### Running the APP

There's currently a very simple GUI implementation. Fire up your IntelliJ IDE (import project) and simply run the main method of the program. The GUI should be self explanatory.

Currently, one should enter the path and filename to a textfile (e.g. data/ada.txt)

#### Running the tests

There is currently no implementation of a test suit for this program. Feel free to add some.
